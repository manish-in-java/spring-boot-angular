# Angular with Spring Boot

[Angular](https://angular.io) is an open-source JavaScript framework for creating [single-page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application). Angular applications can be written in plain-old JavaScript. However, in order to harness the full power of the framework, it is useful to use [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript), which is a superset of JavaScript. One of the design goals of Angular is to completely decouple the client-side code of a web application from the server-side code, allowing development work on the two codebases to progress in parallel. In order to fulfill this design goal, latest versions of Angular use [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com), a JavaScript package manager and build system. Angular code written in TypeScript is compiled into standard-compliant JavaScript, using NPM, before being hosted on a web-server for clients to download. This process ensures that web browsers do not necessarily need to be TypeScript-compliant and can simply work with standard JavaScript code.

Java is a popular programming language for writing server-side code. [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a stack built on top of the open-source Spring framework. Spring Boot makes it easy and straightforward to develop enterprise-grade Java applications with built-in security, performance, monitoring, external integrations, and many other features, through use of appropriate Spring framework components. Spring Boot applications can be built and packaged with Maven or Gradle, the standard packaging and build tools in the Java ecosystem. Both Maven and Gradle utilise a standard folder structure and a build definition file (`pom.xml` for Maven, and `build.gradle` for Gradle).

Developers coming from a Java background are used to the standard structure of a Java project. When they start developing with Angular, they now need to contend with Maven/Gradle for their Java code, and NPM for the Angular code.
